My name is **Helia Shams Zadeh Amiri**, and I am currently completing my **Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering** at the **Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)** in Tehran. From the early stages of my academic journey, I have been deeply interested in how data and algorithms can reveal structure, meaning, and intelligence within complex systems. This curiosity gradually led me toward **data science, machine learning, and natural language understanding** — areas where I now focus my academic and professional efforts.

During my undergraduate studies, I have had the opportunity to explore a wide range of fields — from **computer vision and artificial intelligence** to **semantic knowledge representation** and **bioinformatics**. My undergraduate thesis, *“Transforming Text into Structured Knowledge: A Frame-Semantics and RDF-based Approach,”* reflects my growing interest in bridging **language, logic, and computation** to create interpretable AI systems. I believe that developing models capable of understanding and structuring unstructured data is key to advancing both research and real-world applications.

In parallel with my studies, I have worked as a **Data Scientist at Ferrum Capital (Baku, Azerbaijan)**, where I apply statistical learning and predictive modeling to **credit scoring and financial risk assessment**. This experience has helped me translate theoretical insights into production-ready systems and strengthened my commitment to developing reliable and explainable AI methods.  

Beyond research and development, I have served as a **Teaching Assistant** in several core computer science courses, including *Computer Vision*, *Operating Systems*, *Data Structures*, and *Theory of Automata*. These teaching experiences have honed my ability to communicate complex concepts clearly and have deepened my appreciation for collaborative academic environments.

I am fluent in English (IELTS Band 8.0) and have working knowledge of **German** and **French**, which enables me to engage with international research communities and literature. I enjoy exploring interdisciplinary applications of artificial intelligence — particularly where computation meets language, cognition, and knowledge discovery.

Looking ahead, I aspire to pursue **graduate research** in **machine learning, data mining, and natural language processing**, focusing on the design of adaptive, transparent, and semantically aware AI systems. My long-term goal is to contribute to research that enhances the interpretability and fairness of machine learning while bridging academic inquiry and industrial innovation.
