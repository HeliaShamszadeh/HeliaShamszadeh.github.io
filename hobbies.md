Outside of my academic and professional work, I dedicate time to a few activities that inspire both creativity and focus.

* **Learning German** – I’m currently studying the German language to strengthen my communication skills and connect with European academic culture.

* **Reading Novels** – I enjoy reading contemporary and classic literature, which helps me explore different perspectives and enhance critical thinking.

* **Playing Piano** – Music has always been a meaningful part of my life; playing piano allows me to express creativity and maintain balance alongside technical work.
